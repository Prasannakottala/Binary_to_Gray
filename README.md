# Binary_to_Gray
The binary to Gray code operation is a conversion process where a standard binary number is transformed into its equivalent Gray code representation. Each subsequent Gray bit is obtained by XORing the current binary bit with the previous binary bit.It is used in error correction for digital communication, rotary encoders.
